1. Contiguous Integers:
The expression n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) + 1 results in a perfect square. This outcome is based on the product of four consecutive integers and holds true for specific values of n.

2. Perfect Squares:
For any positive integer n, the difference n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n - 1 represents an odd number. That is, the difference between the squares of two consecutive integers is always an odd number.

3. Sum of First n Natural Numbers:
The formula 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 denotes the sum of the first n natural numbers and can also be interpreted geometrically as the area of a trapezoid.

4. Fermat's Little Theorem:
If p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).

5. Divisibility Rules:
Divisibility rules for various numbers are very useful. For example, a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

6. Goldbach's Conjecture:
According to this conjecture, every even integer n ≥ 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

7. Congruences:
The expression a ≡ b (mod m) means that a and b leave the same remainder when divided by m. This concept plays a significant role in solving various number-theoretic problems.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
If m1, m2, ..., mk are pairwise coprime positive integers and a1, a2, ..., ak are any integers, then the system of congruences x ≡ ai (mod mi) has a unique solution modulo M = m1 * m2 * ... * mk.

9. Sum of Divisors Function:
The function σ(n) denotes the sum of all positive divisors of a number n, and it plays an important role in various mathematical problems.

10. Euler's Totient Function:
Euler’s Totient Function is used to count the number of integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It is particularly significant in number theory and cryptography.

11. Prime Numbers:
Product of two prime numbers always have 4 divisors.
Example:
6 --> 1 , 2 , 3 , 6
15 --> 1 , 3 , 5 , 15
